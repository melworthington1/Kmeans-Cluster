# Kmeans-Cluster
A project task from my Data Science bootcamp on Kmeans Clusters.

The project involved using a jupyter notebook to investigate which socio-economic and health factors best determine a countries' development status.

Tasks involved; pre-processing data, feature selection, data visualisation (scatterplots, pairplot, elbow curve), data scaling and kmeans clustering.

Conclusions where then drawn from the outcomes of the analysis.
